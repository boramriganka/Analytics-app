// we will not use require to import mongoose model, because
// later in testing with mocha,jasmine , we will use require 
// statment multiple times, so it will give an error saying 
// that model has been imported already

// google profile id vs user model id
// google profile id identifies a user coming to us from the oauth flow
// user model instance id identifies a user who is stored in the database
// oath only purpose is to allow someone to sign it.After that,we use our own internal id
